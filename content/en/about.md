I am working for Master degree of Distributed Systems in KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

I am a believer of Arch Linux, I dare not presume to say I am well-known Linux, I had used Arch Linux as the only systemd for 3 years, then I switch back to the Microsoft camp after Microsoft began to do right things. Now I work on Arch Linux as WSL and a plan b system.

I was a crazy fun of Touhou Project. My favorite animation is CLANNAD. CLANNAD helped me to develop the right outlook when I was in junior and senior high school.

I believe Rust is the mainstream language of the future, and I'm trying hard to learn TypeScript, but since my major is distributed, I use more functional languages like Scala and Erlang in my classes (but honestly, functional thinking is really killing me).

In fact, my dream is to be an independent game developer, because I think only a carrier like games, which is not limited by materials or screens, is the best way to tell stories and present art. I also have stories in my heart that I want to tell to everyone, and I hope to tell good 9th art like those that have ever touched me.
